                <p>This app is for the people who like to take their life calmly. For people who prefer talking
                    to get to know one another.
                </p>
                <p>For these reason, whe have some simple rules. You have 280 charachters to send a message to who you want. But you
                    will have to wait to be responded to send another message. So choose well your words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We know you want to see the aspects of the other one. But let's not be impatient. You will see the first photo of eachother
                    after 4 messages. The second after 8 messages and the last one after 12 messages. If you arrive there, congratulations,
                    you have connected with someone!!
